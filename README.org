  I am a Software Architect / Engineer / Developer / Computer Scientist
  or whatever interests me at the moment. I have been at this since before 
  1980, before I even graduated from high school.

  Most of my recent works are here. "Recent", meaning the past 20 years or so.
  Most of my work before then have been lost to the winds of time and 
  dead hard drives and obsoleted formats.

** Background
   One of the very first software that I wrote was a Gravity Well Simulator
   that I wrote for the Apple II back in 1978 or so. I was 16 at the time,
   and what I learned from calculus (which I mastered at 13) made this even
   possible at all. I "reinvented" some numerical methods to do the integration
   necessary. I had very limited access to resources back then, so I did my best.

   In 1980, I wrote an OS from scratch for the Nova 4X computer (Data General),
   including the drivers for the tape transport and the hard drive, the size
   of a washing machine, with the removal disk packs. I was only 18 at the time,
   and had no idea about what it was I was really doing. I had a mentor who guided 
   me a bit, but he was busy writing the C compiler for this machine, and I 
   did help him with that as well.

   It seems that gravity has been tugging at me throughtout my career... well,
   I've always been fascinated by gravity and black holes and in cosmology in general.
   During my Amiga days, I created the Mitchell Gravity Set fractal. I have recreated
   implementations of that on the old MFC framework using the Microsoft C++ compiler and IDE,
   and again on an early version of Qt on Linux back when Qt were referring to themselves 
   as "Trolltech", and now a 3D version is in the works. 3D volumetric / iso-surface 
   rendering is vastly more complex, so it's taking me a bit longer, but it will also represent
   my first major attempts at GPU graphics. My "hello world", if you will.

   Today, after 40 years, I have shifted my career a bit. I now write patents for
   a living. I may go back to being a software engineer at some point, but doubtful.
   I don't like the current state of affairs with the work enviroment and processes
   in place, which, in my humble view, has turned software development into a commodity,
   with just a touch of Marxist approaches. Not ture of every shop, but the creep is there.

   I also now live in Germany, and have been here for the past 6 years at least. Germany 
   is a lovely country, and I like be central to most of Europe. At most, a 90-minute
   flight (assuming direct!!) Ich sprache manche Deutsch!

** Aspirations
   I hope to be able to bring about AGI someday. I already have a good idea how
   to do this, based on the dedicated research of others. However, we will
   ultimately need a new kind of hardware to pull it off. Von Neumann-type machines 
   have an inherent bottleneck. And forget gradient descent approaches, even running
   on GPUs. They simply cannot scale to what is needed.
